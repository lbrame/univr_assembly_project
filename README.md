# Assembly project

The goal of this project is to translate the high-level language code `gestioneVettore.c` into Assembly language.

The Assembly dialect is AT&T syntax. The architecture is x86 (32-bit Assembly). The assembler used is `as`, the GNU Assembler. This project uses Linux system calls and only works on Linux-based systems.
